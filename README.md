# 🌌 Planet Simulation
A realistic simulation of planetary motion using Newtonian physics, built with Pygame. The simulation shows the orbits of the planets in the Solar System as they revolve around the Sun.

## 🚀 Features
- Simulates gravitational attraction between celestial bodies using Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation.
- Accurate orbital motion of planets with real astronomical data.
- Dynamic orbit tracing for each planet.
- Real-time animation using Pygame.
